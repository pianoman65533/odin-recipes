Recipe website project
The current project requires me to build a basic website for recipes. 

It will allow me to demonstrate my ability to put basic text and headings in websites, as well as use both links and images. I will demonstrate my ability to create a boilerplate and my ability to make both ordered and unordered lists on a page other than my homepage.
